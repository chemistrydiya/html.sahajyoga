<p>The time has come for all of you to get your self-realisation, by which your attention becomes enlightened, your health gets completely all right, your mental processes are sensible, but above all you stand in your present.</p>
<h2>What is Sahaja Yoga</h2>
<p>Sahaja Yoga is a method of meditation resulting in evolved spiritual personality through the awakening of Kundalini. This process of Kundalini Awakening called Self Realisation was discovered by H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi in 1970 and has since spread all around the world. This inner awakening is called by many names: Self Realisation, Second Birth, ... Enlightenment etc and it is the goal of all religions and spiritual traditions of the world. The knowledge of Kundalini is ancient, but for a long time, it was available only to a few enlightened souls, being kept secret and transferred from guru to disciple, since Self Realisation was extremely difficult to achieve. In these modern times, through Sahaja ("spontaneous") Yoga ("union with one's Self"), this experience has become effortless and available to everyone through Self Realisation, for the first time in the history of human spirituality.</p>
